      <p class="TEXT-13-dark-gray">When you hire Jacqui Crocetta of Mad&#45;Duck, you are hitting the trifecta.&nbsp; Jacqui is top&#45;notch when it comes to creative talent and professionalism, plus she's a breeze to work with. Finding someone who truly excels at all three is not the norm. (And, she is also a gifted fine artist.) Jacqui designed a monthly publication for me, in addition to doing special projects, during my tenure at Georgetown University Hospital, and it was a joy to work with her.&nbsp; Since then, we have collaborated on additional projects and I have been proud to call her &quot;partner&quot;.&nbsp; My advice: grab on to her and don't let go! </p>

She has an uncanny way of taking a small amount of direction and creating a perfect product that represents our organization's personality and style. She is a consummate professional with the ability to interact on a personal level with clients. I would highly recommend Jacqui and Mad Duck Creative LLC for any creative work you might require.</p>

We have found her services to be timely and creative. Her input and suggestions have helped us develop and enhance our company's branding. In particular, Jacqui designed our logo and all of our graphic designs that appear in our publications, web site, and letterhead. Her availability and quick response time has helped us complete projects expeditiously.</p>

      <p class="TEXT-13-dark-gray">I was fortunate to be able to work with Jacqui on two separate and very different projects for two very different clients; in both cases Jacqui was charming and the consummate professional while delivering spectacularly creative and artistic solutions that were uniquely her own. Her ability to listen/assess/design solutions for a client is amazing. As an architect &amp; interior designer, I understand how a project becomes much more successful when there is a talented collaborative team. Jacqui brings great things to the creative table &amp; I look forward to the next time we are able to work together. </p>

      <p class="TEXT-13-dark-gray">I have worked with Mad Duck Creative for more than five years, and have been consistently impressed with the quality and timeliness of their work. Mad Duck designs MedStar Georgetown University Hospital’s monthly employee newsletter, which is a critical part of the Hospital’s internal communications function. With every issue, Mad Duck keeps the publication bright, dynamic and appealing to our internal audience. In fact, the Hospital recently overhauled its brand and Mad Duck responded with an absolutely fantastic new look for the newsletter that exceeded our expectations and was very well received by the organization. Here’s the bottom line… if you want creative communications that hit the mark every time with top&#45;notch quality and personal, friendly service, look no further than Mad Duck – you won’t be disappointed!</p>

      <p class="TEXT-13-dark-gray">When I first came to work with my new community we did not have a professional brochure. Mad Duck was suggested to create and design our new collateral piece. The time and sincere planning to customize and create our information piece was fantastic. They really poured their heart and soul into making the piece a paper version of what our community has to offer and brought it to life for the prospects to read. The staff was very considerate of working with our seniors and extremely respectful of being in their home.</p>
      <p class="TEXT-13-dark-gray">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="TEXT-13-dark-gray">Mad Duck was also responsible for developing our website, direct mail and print ads. I look forward to having the opportunity to work with Mad Duck again, and would recommend their services wholeheartedly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

      <p class="TEXT-13-dark-gray">When I need experienced, detailed advice on a project, I can always turn to Jacqui. Her knowledge of how consumers react to a variety of presentations is indispensable. I find that her information is not just anecdotal either. Jacqui has made it a point to stay current on the trends, so that she can deliver a beautiful piece that is also effective. Creativity is a huge part of the design process, and there is no shortage of that with Jacqui either. Once you have seen her samples, you'll be convinced. If you still need more, ask her about those wonderful holiday cards.</p>
